## Testing

### Development

When you are developing a new feature or checking an existing feature you can open the Cypress app on your machine, select the sp_front project and run the specific feature file.

### Regression

When making a change likely to have impact on several parts of the app you should run the full regression on your machine using (if you want to check the coverage remove the prefix flag):

```shell
CYPRESS_COVERAGE=false npm run tests:chrome
```

You can also run the tests in parallel for reduced execution time (~40%):

```shell
CYPRESS_COVERAGE=false npm run tests:chrome:parallel
```

## Visual Regression

We use the visual regression plugin to detect unexpected changes in the UI with a threshold of 10% (more than this will cause the build to fail).

When there are indeed valid changes then we need to rebase the visual baseline in CI with the job `snapshots_rebase_sp_front`.
Then we need to download the images from `cypress/snapshots/base` and update the repo.
